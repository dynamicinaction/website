For the first few months of this project, we've been working behind the scenes to establish the building blocks of this project. Much of this has included putting together the necessary pieces to enable our Data Science team to be able to work with the community.

This work has included:
* Submitting for, and receiving, IRB approval from Arizona State University to do this research and data science work in partnership with the community
* Building additional tools and processes to help analyze diabetes data from the anonymized data sets likely to be used in the team's work
* Running sample projects to familiarize the Data Science Team with diabetes in general, plus some of the unique data structures 
* Figuring out the processes for working with the community!

And now, the team is ready to partner with the community! This is a core part of this project work, and we're excited to get started. We know there are many research questions that members of the diabetes community have, and we're excited to explore them together. We know some people have very specific research questions; while others may want to explore potential research questions in partnership with the Data Science Team. We expect to learn a lot from our collaborations: better understanding what types of questions people are interested in analyzing; better understanding how data can be analyzed or collected to facilitate future research work; and learning what opportunities there are to provide tools, toolkits, and other resources to people who are interested in health-related research. 

If you're interested in partnering with the Data Science Team, please fill out the short Google Form to let us know that you're interested! We'll get back to you as soon as possible, and we can begin having conversations about the potential research work.
