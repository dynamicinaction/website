Terms of Agreement

Thank you for using our website.

# Scope

This website (www.openingpathways.org) and all related communications (the “Site”) is provided by ”Opening Pathways for discovery, research, and innovation in health and healthcare”, which is a project with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to explore the discovery, research, and innovation processes being used by non-traditional stakeholders in healthcare. The Opening Pathways project has Co-Principal Investigators and several research core team members, advisors, and consultants (“the Opening Pathways research team”). For purposes of these Terms of Agreement (“Terms”), we use the terms “Opening Pathways,”  “we,” and “us”to include the Opening Pathways research team, as well as the institutions and employers with which the Opening Pathways research team members are associated, and the organizations that provide funding for the Opening Pathways project. The Site includes online  communications between you and the Opening Pathways research team via blog comments or any other medium, including email associated with the website.

# Acceptance of Terms

**Whenever you visit or use the Site, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to visit or use the Site. Please read the Terms carefully.**

# Updates to these Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time, although we expect that most changes would only reflect updates or be editorial in nature. Any such modifications to the Terms take effect immediately upon posting, and your continued visit to or use of the Site constitutes your consent to the modified Terms. In the highly unlikely event that we would change these Terms in a way that would be materially detrimental to your interests, we would post a prominent notice on the Site for at least 30 days before doing so, giving visitors an opportunity to consent or decline to the new Terms. Visitors to the Site could also ask us to delete their prior comments or personal information, as explained further in our [Privacy Policy](http://openingpathways.org/privacy.html). If you did not consent to the new Terms, you would not be permitted to use the Site. 

The date of the last update to these Terms is stated at the end of this document.

All matters related to the Site will be governed by the laws of Washington, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions.

If you have a complaint, question, or dispute (collectively, “dispute”) regarding the Site, you are encouraged to bring it to our attention. You may email us at team@openingpathways.org, and we will try to address your concerns. If we are unable to resolve a dispute ourselves, any dispute relating in any way to the Site shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in King County, Washington, in, except that to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any federal or state court. Arbitration under these Terms shall be conducted in accordance with the prevailing rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association, with each party being responsible for its own costs and fees, and the joint costs of arbitration being shared equally by the parties. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

You agree that, regardless of any law or statute, any claim or cause of action you may have against us must be brought within one year after the claim or cause of action arises or is known or should reasonably have been known to you, or the claim or cause of action will be forever barred.

# Other Legal Provisions

Any failure or delay by either party to enforce any part of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that party’s rights under these Terms. These Terms control the relationship between you and the creators of this website. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If we enter into an additional or separate agreement with you that has additional terms, those additional terms will control if they conflict with these Terms. If a particular provision of these Terms is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the other provisions will remain in effect. You may not transfer your account or your rights under these Terms to any other person or entity. We may, in our sole discretion, transfer, delegate, or assign our rights and obligations under these Terms to others without notifying you or obtaining your consent.
