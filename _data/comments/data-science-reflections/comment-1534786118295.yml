  Thanks, Dave. There's definitely an entire topic's worth of pros/cons related
  to Facebook groups. I think it depends on the membership, and the purpose of
  the group, and making sure everyone is aware of the privacy implications of
  the choice(s). For some groups - patients talking about personal experiences -
  they might not want to use Facebook groups. For other groups - not talking
  about personal experiences; would otherwise be talking about the same content
  publicly, but want the convenience of Facebook features/login - it may not
  matter as much to that group. It's definitely something worth discussing for
  any group selecting any channel.
