  I think there is probably a middle road, with solving real time stuff balanced
  with ease of export and analysis of data. I think scale facilitates this, but
  negotiation of a DIY solver and a data scientist researcher takes work,
  patience, strong communication. I am just reprising your second-to-last
  paragraph, but I just love this post, learning so much about the data science
  side and putting it in my pocket for future projects.
