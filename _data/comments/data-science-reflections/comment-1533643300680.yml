message: "As always, watching from a distance, admiring the trailblazing work you're doing!\r\n\r\nFor future reference, don't even let anyone THINK about using a Facebook group. This summer it's become very apparent that FB's security is disastrously bad, whether they leak for commercial benefit or they just don't know how to keep a group \"closed.\" Here's the SPM post about two major screw-ups - there's reason to think that Cambridge Analytica was (a) not a rare screw-up and (b) not sufficient to get FB's geniuses to fix the problem (if they can). https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2018/07/save-the-date-facebook-patient-privacy-scandal-important-bcsm-twitter-chat-monday-9pm-et.html\r\n\r\nNote that one leak may have enabled marketers to scrape group members' names using just a browser extension, and in another case trolls hacked into a group and behaved so severely that FB immediately destroyed the group. \r\n\r\nIf someone wants to create a private group, much better to do it somewhere like Inspire.com or SmartPatients.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile keep blazing the trail!  Your message about actual research partners comes through loud & clear here. Thank you!"
