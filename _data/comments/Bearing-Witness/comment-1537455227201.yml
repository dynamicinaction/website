  Thank you for this thoughtful response, Lisa!  +1 on your post, particularly
  this (for me). "Perhaps the lightning bolt was a gut check to bear witness,
  period. I know there is a lot of talk about work-life balance. Maybe theyâ€™re
  not so distinctly different worlds, rather similar skill sets practiced in
  different contexts? Pretty sure that today, after school, I will practice
  being fully present with my family."  =)
