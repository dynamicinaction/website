  Thank you for sharing. I stumbled upon this post from a happenstance Twitter
  feed. As one of "your" former students and as a professional, I was intrigued.
  I started reading and could follow your train of thought as a professional and
  could parallel some of my own experiences. Ironically and unexpectedly, for
  me, as I continued reading my parent identity creeped in... specifically at
  this line, "I contributed by being fully present, fully listening, fully
  engaged, fully empathicâ€¦ and silent (as best as I could; will work on being
  better at being silent in the future now that I understand this type of
  contribution)." As the mother of 2 amazing middle school children (note-middle
  school; adolescence; period of transition often referred to as "turbulent"),
  this line hit me like lightening bolt and pulled me from work mode to mom
  mode. Perhaps the lightning bolt was a gut check to bear witness, period. I
  know there is a lot of talk about work-life balance. Maybe they're not so
  distinctly different worlds, rather similar skill sets practiced in different
  contexts? Pretty sure that today, after school, I will practice being fully
  present with my family. Didn't see that one coming when I opened a blog for
  work. Thanks for the read and self-reflection.
